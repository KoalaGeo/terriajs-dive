# terriajs-dive
A place to raise and discuss issues surrounding the 2016 CDI Proposal ["Evaluating a new opensource, standards-based framework for web portal development in the geosciences"](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56d87a7de4b015c306f6cfcf).

Let's try to use Github issues instead of e-mail discussion, as they work much effective for technical subjects, and we will have project related correspondence captured in one place.   So instead of creating a new e-mail, just raise a new issue on the [issues page] (https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/issues).
